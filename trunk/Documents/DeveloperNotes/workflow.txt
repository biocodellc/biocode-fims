1. Initiation
    - create expedition, make a expedition code: used to request/assign identifiers
    - specify a configuration file
        - validation
        - mapping
    - specify a spreadsheet template based on DwC /MIxS properties, clumped by classes

2. Loading Sample Data
    - AUTHENTICATE
    - VALIDATE
    - TRIPLIFY (as RDF using D2RQ)
    - UPLOAD spreadsheet
    - ARCHIVE loaded data, assign DOI, store in GitHub

3. Loading Sequence Data
Relies on loaded sampleData, must exist there first before continuing
    - FASTA (containing many sampleIDs) + Locus + Expedition code
    - SNP data (containing many loci) + Expedition code + SampleID
    - NextGen data (containing many loci) + Expedition code + SampleID

3. Query & Extract
    - Return spreadsheet
       - Parameterized queries (Java/Sparql)

4. Resolver
    - Use EZIDs for resolution


Development
First iteration will be simply series of curl calls the user can implement.
Then REST service
