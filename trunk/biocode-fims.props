# Specifications for reading various RDF vocabulary files.  These settings are used by the
# Vocabulary classes to read in vocabulary sets for use by the Triplifier.  The members are
# as follows.
#
# cName: URI to identify "class" objects in a vocabulary.
# cProperty: URI of "class" designation property (usually just rdf:type).
# cSubClass: URI of subClass Predicate
# pName: URI to identify "property" objects in a vocabulary.
# pSubProperty: URI of subProperty Predicate
# domain: URI of domain property
# range: URI of range property
#
# Specification for standard RDF (and RDFS) vocabulary files.
