#The following are instructions for creating a project

= Introduction =

Creating a project creates a project code in the BCID system and also creates relevant BCID objects associated with concept groups.  There are two types of projects available: dwc and biocode-fims.

= Details =

Creating a new project can be done using the "createProject" executable in the java code-base.  Currently, this must be done by a system administrator and is not meant to be run by casual users.  Usage is:

{{{
usage: createProject input_files [-c <arg>] [-h] [-p <arg>] [-t <arg>] [-u <arg>]
 -c,--project_code <arg>   Your proposed project code.  Must be between 4
                           and 6 characters and NOT exist within the BCID
                           system
 -h,--help                 Print this help message and exit
 -p,--password <arg>       The BCID application password
 -t,--type <arg>           {dwc|biocode-fims} indicates the types of
                           classes to associate with this project
 -u,--username <arg>       The BCID application username
}}}

Usernames/passwords correspond to usernames/passwords in the BCID system.
