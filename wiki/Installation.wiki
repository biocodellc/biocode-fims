#summary Installing Biocode FIMS

= Introduction =

This content is for people wishing to install Biocode-FIMS on their own server.

= Details =

Biocode-FIMS consists of a core set of Java classes and REST services.  Integration with the [http://code.google.com/p/bcid BCID] system is required and developers have a choice of using the [http://biscicol.org/bcid Biocode Commons BCID] installation or installing their own using the [http://code.google.com/p/bcid BCID google code site] which requires purchase of an [http://ezid.cdlib.org/ EZID account].

To run an instance of Biocode-FIMS you will need the following components:

  * A unix-based server
  * A java servlet container e.g. Tomcat, Glassfish, Jetty
  * Connection to a BCID service

Installation and Build

  * Source code is available on this site via Subversion
  * Building is done via an Ant build file (provided as part of the distribution)
  * a properties file needs to be configured by copying biocode-fims.template to biocode-fims.props (in the root directory of the distribution) 

Optional Component
  * A triple-store database connection for storing datasets as RDF triples.  We have tested using [http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/ Apache Fuseki]

= Additional Installation Instructions =
   * The source contains a sample property file called biocode-fims.template which should be copied to biocode-fims.props  -- you will need to adjust references in this document. 
      * Note that references to URLs should begin with "www" as in www.biscicol.org instead of biscicol.org since some browsers (e.g. Firefox) automatically add the "www" and this changes the session designation and creates problems during logging in.

= Notes =
  * It is recommended ALL service calls in the properties file begin with a "www" in the hostname.
