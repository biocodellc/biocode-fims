Specifications for FASTA file upload functionality

Allow user to upload FASTA files through the validation page.  This will be just like uploading spreadsheet (and in fact use the same box?) 
but the main difference is that you cannot create an expedition during this step if it is a FASTA file, the expedition must have been
created during a metadata file upload.  So:
1) Indicate file for upload
   a) Is Metadata?  -- proceed w/ metadata loader/validator as is.
   b) Is FASTA file? (create rules for checking fasta file structure) --
      i ) ask user to specify an ALREADY created expedition
      ii ) validate that FASTA IDs match metadata IDs

FASTA files will be added as a line in the BCID table with resourceType = XXXXXX. (DCMI does not have a term for sequence data, closest 
match is Dataset but we're using that already-- need a term that indicates this is an assembled sequence) and stored as its own n3 data in 
the database.   Another option is to keep as Dataset and indicate a new field that has the Dataset type (ResourceSubType), and we can fetch each new dataset type
as needed (e.g. dataset, sequence, image reference, etc.)

Query will lookup all associated resourceTypes/resourceSubType and union them together.
